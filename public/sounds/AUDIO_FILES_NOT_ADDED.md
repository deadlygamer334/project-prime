# Audio Files Not Yet Added

The Focus Mixer is configured to use 21 audio files, but they haven't been added yet.

**This is expected!** The audio files are placeholders until you add real audio.

## Quick Fix

The website will work normally - you just won't hear any sounds until you add the audio files to this directory.

## To Add Audio Files

See the main [README.md](./README.md) for the complete list of required files and where to find free sound resources.

## Current Status

✅ Focus Mixer UI is fully functional
✅ Volume controls work
✅ Presets and randomization work
❌ No audio will play until files are added

Once you add even one audio file (e.g., `white-noise.mp3`), that sound will work immediately!
